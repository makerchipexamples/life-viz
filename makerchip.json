In this \"game\", a grid of cells (10x10) are born and die based on the
number of live neighbors they have in each step (clock cycle).
A cell's neighbors are the surrounding 8 cells, which includes the
diagonals.</p>
<p>
 <ul>
  <li>A cell is born if exactly 3 neighbors are alive.</li>
  <li>A cell dies from overcrowding or starvation if it have greater than 3 or less than 2
    neighbors.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>Output shows the grid in each step of simulation.</p>",
